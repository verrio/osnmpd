.SH NAME
osnmpd - SNMPv3 daemon responding on incoming SNMP requests.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B osnmpd
.RI [ options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BI osnmpd
is a minimal SNMP agent implementation, to be used for basic system monitoring.  The agent process binds on a predefined UDP port and listens for incoming requests.  In addition to that, unsolicited trap/inform events can be dispatched from any process within the system to a predefined monitoring process.  Only a minimal set of MIB attributes are present by default;  additional attributes can be exported through means of shared objects.
